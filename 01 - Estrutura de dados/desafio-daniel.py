# Resolution of the challenge from the DIO - Data Engineer Bootcamp

"""
Challenge: Separate the withdrawal, deposit and bank statement options in functions.
    - Establish a daily limit of 10 transactions per account. If the client tries to make a transaction after he reached his daily limit, a warning should appear on the screen.
    - Create two new functions: <create new client> and <create new bank account>. You may create as many additional functions as you like.
        $ <create new client>
            * the <create new client> function should contain name, birth date, id, and address.
            * the address should follow this format: street - neighborhood - city/state code.
            * two different clients cannot have the same id.
            * one client can have more than one account, but each account should belong to a single client.
        $ <create new bank account>
            * should contain agency id, account number and client
            * the agency id is always "0001"
            * the account number is sequential, iniciating at "1".
            * one client can have more than one account, but each account should belong to a single client.
    - ALL OPERATIONS should be created by using functions.
    - the <withdrawal> function should be keyword only; it should return the <current balance> and the <bank statement> variables.
    - the <deposit> function should be positional only; it should also return the <current balance> and the <bank statement> variables.
    - the <bank statement> function should be have both: <current balance> (positional) and <bank statement> (keyword).
        * also, the bank statement should include the date and time of all transations.
